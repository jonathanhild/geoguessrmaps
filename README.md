WinCo Foods is an employee-owned grocery store chain in the Western US. The WinCo name comes from a 1999 company contest to rename the chain, which the winning name is a portmanteau of Winning Company and the states in which the chain operates in (Washington, Idaho, Nevada, California, and Oregon). But don't assume that they haven't expanded since then!
