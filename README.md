WinCo Foods is an employee-owned grocery store chain in the Western US. The WinCo name comes from a 1999 company contest to rename the chain, which the winning name is a portmanteau of Winning Company and the states in which the chain operates in (Washington, Idaho, Nevada, California, and Oregon). But don't assume that they haven't expanded since then!

### Benson Bubblers
Play: 

In 1912, Simon Benson donated $10,000 for public water fountains around Portland, Oregon. These became known as "Benson Bubblers" because of the constant bubbly flow of water from the fountains. Combined, the fountains normally pour out close to 100,000 gallons of drinking water per day every day of the year, except during extremely cold weather. Today, they remain one of the most iconic features of the city.
